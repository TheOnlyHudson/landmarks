/**
 * Spotify Camp Nou, Barcelona, as rebuilt in 2023-2026 — original
 * procedural geometry, CC0-1.0. bun generators/barcelona-camp-nou.ts
 *
 * Uses the kit exported by generators/barcelona-arc-de-triomf.ts.
 *
 * Modelled as photographed in September 2026 (the newest licensed photos:
 * the bowl in use on 16 September 2026, the outside in July and September
 * 2025): three tiers of stands round the pitch, the upper tier rebuilt, the
 * outside a stack of cantilevered concourse rings on an exposed steel frame.
 * The new roof was not yet built and is not modelled; nor are the cranes.
 *
 * Frame: built turned to the pitch, BEARING 68.4: +-x is the pitch's long
 * axis (north-north-west / south-south-east), +-y its short axis. z up,
 * metres. Origin = the centroid of the OSM stadium outline way/34607291, the
 * centre spot; y = 0 is the pitch. `elevation` 0: the map's terrain already
 * holds the bowl (the pitch 10-12 m below the streets), so the map's own
 * lowest point is the pitch; with -8 the terrain check buries the lower
 * tier by 6.7 m.
 *
 * Evidence
 * - OSM way/34607291 (Spotify Camp Nou, leisure=stadium, Q159848), the
 *   construction outline relation/5503051 (building=construction, +-104 x
 *   +-81 m in this frame: the old stadium's footprint) and the old stands'
 *   parts relation/4094584, 4094585, 4094587, 4094588 (5 to 25 m).
 * - ICGC orthophoto (Institut Cartografic i Geologic de Catalunya,
 *   ortofoto_color_vigent WMS, CC BY 4.0), taken during the works: the
 *   plan. The bowl's rings, fitted as superellipses over it: the pitch edge
 *   +-58 x +-40, the first tier's rim +-86 x +-68, the second's +-108 x
 *   +-88, the top +-120 x +-100, the new steel frame from +-122 x +-102 at the
 *   street, the top eave to +-134 x +-114.
 * - Published (ca/en.wikipedia "Camp Nou", "Espai Barca"): rebuilt from 2023
 *   (Nikken Sekkei, B720), reopened in November 2025 with the third tier
 *   still being built; about 105,000 seats when complete; a roof to come.
 *   The pitch lies about 8 m below the surrounding streets (the 1957 bowl
 *   was dug into the ground); the model's street-level concourse is at 8.
 * - Mapterhorn terrain (bun tools/terrain.ts grid, check): the bowl reads
 *   10-12 m deep under the pitch's surroundings; the check passes with
 *   elevation 0.
 * - Commons photos (EVIDENCE):
 *   "Camp nou 2026.png" (Elad Eisenhammer, CC BY 4.0, 16 September 2026;
 *   the bowl from the lower tier: garnet seats, the third tier, no roof);
 *   "Camp Nou under renovation - Sept. 21, 2025.jpg" (SimpleObjects-9ei,
 *   CC BY-SA 4.0; the outside, the steel frame of the third tier and the
 *   ring concourses);
 *   "Obres del Camp Nou - 20250718 193920.jpg" (Pere Lopez Brosa, CC BY-SA
 *   4.0; the main front, the cantilevered rings and their white soffits).
 *
 * The third tier's exposed steel trusses are a zig-zag of bold braces round
 * the frame's top band (48, fewer than the real ones).
 *
 * Estimated from the photos: the tiers' heights (first to 15, second to 33,
 * third to 50 above the pitch), the frame leaning out 7 m from the street
 * (at 8) to the top (50), the concourse rings at 16, 24, 33 and 42 and the
 * top eave at 50, cantilevering 4.5-5 m past it. Colours from the
 * daylight photos, pulled to the palette's lightness: garnet seats, white
 * concrete rings, charcoal steel, the concourses' glazing (lit at night).
 *
 * Doubts: no licensed photo of the outside from 2026 was found, so the
 * cladding (if any was added in 2026) is not shown; the third tier's
 * completion round the whole bowl is taken from the 2026 photo's side; the
 * 8 m depth is the commonly published figure, not a measured section.
