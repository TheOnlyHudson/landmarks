/**
 * Apple Fifth Avenue (Bohlin Cywinski Jackson 2006; cube rebuilt with 15
 * panels 2011; store and plaza rebuilt by Foster + Partners 2017-19), the
 * glass cube on the General Motors Building plaza, 767 Fifth Avenue,
 * Manhattan. Procedural, CC0-1.0.
 *   bun generators/nyc-apple-fifth-avenue.ts
 *
 * The first model here with translucent glass (STYLE.md, "Translucent
 * glass"): the cube is pale blue `glass` at opacity 0.3, double-sided, so the map
 * draws what stands inside it. An empty glass box reads as nothing, so the
 * cube carries what is really seen through it.
 *
 * What makes it itself, and the photo each comes from:
 * 1. a clear glass cube, 32 ft on a side, of three full-height panels a
 *    wall and three on the roof, on a pale stone plaza in front of the GM
 *    Building (a, t, v);
 * 2. the Apple logo hanging in the upper middle of the cube, facing Fifth
 *    Avenue, on a rod from the roof's beams (a, t, v, c);
 * 3. the mirror-steel cylinder of the lift at the centre, the spiral stair
 *    round it going down into the store (a, n, t);
 * 4. the glass entrance vestibule on the Fifth Avenue face (a, t, v);
 * 5. the plaza: eighteen round mirror-steel "sky lenses" in two 3 x 3
 *    groups north and south of the cube, flush round skylights, steps down
 *    to the Fifth Avenue sidewalk, and the planters round the secondary
 *    stairs at the ends (n, t, v, OSM).
 *
 * Frame: authored x east, y north, z up, metres (mesh.ts converts), turned
 * to the Manhattan grid: model north is up Fifth Avenue, bearing 29. In
 * that frame OSM's cube, plaza, lenses and planters all fall on the axes.
 * Origin: the centre of the cube (the centroid of OSM way/156958129),
 * -73.9729641, 40.7638426, on the sidewalk's level; the plaza deck is
 * H_P = 0.6 m above it.
 *
 * Published (Wikipedia, "Apple Fifth Avenue", citing the NYT, Foster +
 * Partners and Apple; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Fifth_Avenue):
 * - cube 32 ft (9.75 m) on each side; 15 glass panels since 2011,
 *   unchanged in 2017-19: three a wall and three on the roof, so each wall
 *   shows two vertical joints and no horizontal ones (photos a, t agree);
 * - a mirrored stainless-steel cylinder holding the lift, 43 cantilevered
 *   steps round it, short glass walls on the steps;
 * - 18 sky lenses (reflective steel shells with glass tops, used as seats),
 *   nine each side of the entrance in three rows of three;
 * - 62 circular frosted skylights flush with the plaza's stone floor.
 * OSM (ODbL; https://www.openstreetmap.org, fetched 2026-11-02):
 * - cube way/156958129 (9.1 m square; the published 9.75 m is used);
 * - plaza multipolygon relation/17344272 and its outer way/1262390676: the
 *   Fifth Avenue edge at x = -12.4, the GM Building's face at x = 16.6,
 *   wider ends to x = 22.6, y from -30.6 to 30.1;
 * - the 18 sky lenses, way/1262390689-1262390706 (`window=skylight`),
 *   2.06 m across, centres used as mapped;
 * - steps down to the sidewalk: 2 (north), 3 (middle), 4 (south) steps
 *   over 1.3 m, way/1262390688, 1262390709, 1262390686, so the deck is
 *   about 0.6 m above the sidewalk; drawn as three 0.2 m steps along the
 *   whole edge, as photos t and a show;
 * - the secondary stairs and their 1 m retaining walls and planters,
 *   way/1262390669-1262390683.
 * Measured from photos, scaled by the cube's 9.75 m:
 * - logo 2.2 m tall, its centre 6.0 m above the floor, at the cube's
 *   centre (a, with the perspective of the cube's back edges); its width
 *   follows from the traced outline, 1.79 m (1.7 m was measured);
 * - logo 0.2 m thick (t: its grey edge against the face, seen about 33
 *   degrees off square; a shows the edge only as a thin rim round the bite);
 * - the hanger (a, t): one slender rod rises from the top of the body, just
 *   left of the leaf, to a bar under the roof that spans between two
 *   east-west glass roof beams (a: the beams recede from the west wall's
 *   joints as converging clamped blades, the bar crossing between them
 *   above the logo; t: the rod and the beam it meets). The roof's glass
 *   beams run both ways, a 3 x 3 grid (a, t);
 * - lift cylinder 2.6 m across, standing 2.9 m above the floor (a);
 * - vestibule 3.4 m wide, 3.5 m tall, projecting 1.5 m (a: its underside
 *   shows as a 0.1 m band from the street; t);
 * - sky lenses about 0.45 m tall (n); flush skylights about 1.5 m across
 *   on a pitch of about 3.8 m (a: the row in front of the cube).
 * Estimated or invented:
 * - the flush skylights' layout: 51 discs on a 3.8 m grid clear of the
 *   cube and lenses, where the real 62 are spread over the plaza (n, t
 *   show rows of them; no plan was found);
 * - the stairwell: 3.4 m opening radius, treads 1.35-3.2 m from the
 *   centre, and its direction of turn. The real stair drops 7 m to the
 *   store; the model can't go below the street, so one turn of treads is
 *   drawn falling through the 0.6 m deck over the store's lit floor, which
 *   reads as a stair going down from above;
 * - the frame: the real cube is all but frameless (silicone joints, glass
 *   fins, small steel fittings). STYLE.md asks for a solid frame to carry
 *   the outline, so the edges are thin pale steel bars; the joints are glass
 *   fins 0.6 m deep (estimated), which the map draws nearly opaque edge-on;
 * - the hanger's size: the real rod is a few centimetres thick and too
 *   thin to read on the map (STYLE.md), so the rod is drawn 0.16 m and
 *   the bar 0.24 m wide, in a steel darker than the frame's so they read
 *   through the glass;
 * - the east-west roof joints' thin steel seals: a, t show steel clamps on
 *   those beams, but which way the three roof panels' joints run is not
 *   clear, so both directions are sealed alike;
 * - the planters' tops, drawn as plain stone (they hold honey locusts).
 * Left out: the honey locusts and benches in the groves at the ends, the
 *   doors, the balustrades round the stair, the GM Building itself (not
 *   replaced).
 *
 * The logo (traced): Wikimedia Commons, "Apple logo black.svg", one path
 * in a 814 x 1000 viewBox, the body with its bite then the leaf.
 *   https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_logo_black.svg
 * Commons marks it public domain: the shape is too simple for copyright.
 * It is still Apple's trademark; it is drawn here only because it is on
 * the building.
 *
 * Night (n, 2021): the cube is clear and dark, its inside lit: the steel
 * cylinder and the floor round it shine, the glass edges glow, the flush
 * skylights and the lens tops glow white from the store below. So the
 * steel and stone inside the cube carry `floodlight`, the skylights and
 * lens tops are `window`, and so is the store floor seen down the
 * stairwell (the same lit store; it was `entrance`, which glows alike, and
 * gave its material slot to the hanger), the logo is `neon-apple`, and the
 * glass stays `glass`. The hanger is floodlit like the steel, so the lit
 * logo isn't left floating.

 * The NAIP orthophoto was tried and is useless here: the GM Building leans
 * over the plaza.
 *
 * Doubts: whether a second logo faces north and south (a shows a thin
 * edge-on sliver north of centre, t a faint second apple, either a
 * reflection or another logo; one logo, lit both sides, is drawn); the
 * logo's depth in the cube (centre assumed); the skylight layout; the
 * stair's turn; the plaza's height varies 0.3-0.65 m along the sidewalk.
